Data Structures are used to organize data. Algorithms are procedures to process data. 

Data Structures can be linear or non-linear. Linear Data Structures include Stack and Queue. A Stack follows the LIFO principle. A Queue follows the FIFO principle.

Non-Linear Data Structures include Tree and Graph. A Tree is a hierarchical structure. A Graph is a network of nodes. A Binary Search Tree is a special type of Tree. A Binary Search Tree is used for fast searching.

Algorithms can be for sorting or searching. Sorting Algorithms include Quick Sort and Merge Sort. Searching Algorithms include Binary Search. Binary Search is used on sorted data.
