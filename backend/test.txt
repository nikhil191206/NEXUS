Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence. It enables computers to learn from data without explicit programming.

Deep Learning is a type of Machine Learning that uses Neural Networks with multiple layers. Deep Learning revolutionized Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing.

BERT is a transformer model developed by Google. BERT uses bidirectional training to understand context in text. BERT revolutionized Natural Language Processing tasks.

Convolutional Neural Networks are used in Computer Vision. They are particularly effective for image recognition tasks.

Dropout is a regularization technique used in Neural Networks. Dropout prevents Overfitting by randomly deactivating neurons during training.

Backpropagation is an algorithm that enables Neural Networks to learn. It uses gradient descent to minimize the loss function.
